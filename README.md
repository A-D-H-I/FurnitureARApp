# Furniture AR App

Furniture AR App is an Android application that helps users visualize furniture in their real environment using Augmented Reality. The app allows users to browse furniture online, place 3D models in their room, and measure real-world distances to check if items fit properly.

This project was built as part of learning and experimenting with ARCore and Android development using Kotlin.
